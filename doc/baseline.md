# Baseline
This will be the place to keep shared resources such as style guides, images, utility classes, formatters, types, etc .... Generally, anything that are shared across control libraries are kept in [ute.ui.base](ZEBASE_CTRL/src/ute/ui/base/README.md) and anything that are shared across modules and components are kept in [nrg.base](ZEBASE/src/nrg/base/README.md). Please refer to [respective baseline documentation](../README.md#markdown-header-baseline) for details.
