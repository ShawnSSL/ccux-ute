# Build
This section details how CCUX build system works. You might have performed your first build from [here](getting_started.md/#markdown-header-first-build) and wondered what was going on.

> Please make sure that you have installed all the necessary [build modules](getting_started.md/#markdown-header-install-build-modules).

## Overview
CCUX build system primary goal is to generate an optimized set of files to run the application. On a high level, this is achieved by transforming the actual source files through a series of compression, mangling and concatenation.

CCUX is using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate its build tasks and build steps are custom tailored to the each of the scenarios below:

* [Module](#markdown-header-module)
* [Control](#markdown-header-control)
* [Baseline](#markdown-header-baseline)
* [Component](#markdown-header-component)

You can run `build.bat` on Windows or `build.sh` on Mac to build the entire application covering all scenarios.
