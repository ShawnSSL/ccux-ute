#Controls
The controls here are mean to supersedes the controls in `ZECTRL_COMMONS`. `ZECTRL_MAIN` controls are designed based on how we would use them in modules. Generally, `ZECTRL_MAIN` controls are leaning towards CSS for alterations, so keep the design as general as possible and leave the styling in view's CSS.

* [DropdownItem]()
* [Infoline]()
* [Label]()
* [RadioButton]()
* [TabBar]()
